# U.S.-Higher-Education-Prediction
NEU ALY6015 Group Project
Authors: Kejiang Yao, Xiaozhu Zhao, Yu Qiu
##  Questions this project aims to answer:
1. How does students’ financial burden influence the completion rate of US higher education institutions?  
2. What are the differences between public and private universities regarding ethnicity and completion rate?  
3. Does schools’ ownership and region have influences on schools’ completion rate? (What factors affect completion rate?)  
4. Could completion rate and ownership of US universities be well predicted by ethnicity, commitment, degree level and region?

## Dataset Introduction  

The dataset used in this report is the college scorecard from the U.S. Department of education. This dataset includes information like aggregations of the standardized test scores, students’ races, financial status, enrollment number, admission rate, degrees, completion rate, alumni income, etc from 1997 to 2015. There are 132,402 observations and 66 variables in this data set. To focus on the problems this report is going to solve, we selected part of the variables for analysis.  
1. 2 Outcome variables: Completion Rate, Control of Institutions  
2. 13 Predictor variables: States, Median Debt, Control of Institutions, Average Beginning Age, Percentage of Female Students, Undergraduate Enrollment, Percentage of White Students, Percentage of Black Students, Percentage of Hispanic Students, Percentage of Asian/Pacific Islander, Percentage of Native American/Alaska Native Students, Percentage of Part Time Students
